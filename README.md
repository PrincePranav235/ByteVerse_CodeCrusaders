# Problem Statement
With the ever-increasing amount of content being uploaded to YouTube, it has becomeincreasingly challenging for viewers, specially Students, to consume and comprehendthevastamount of information presented in lengthy video transcripts. The absence of aquickandefficient way to extract relevant information from these transcripts hinders theabilityofviewers to gain valuable insights from the content. As a result, there is a growingneedforaYouTube transcript summarizer tool that can extract key information and present it inaconcise,easy-to-understand format, enabling users to consume content more efficiently andeffectively.Therefore, the problem statement is how to develop a reliable YouTube transcript summarizertool that can extract and present essential information from lengthy video transcriptsinaconcise and user-friendly format. 

# Description of Project Idea
The project idea is to develop a YouTube transcript summarizer tool that can efficiently and accurately
summarize lengthy video transcripts, making it easier for viewers to consume content more effectively. Thetool
will be designed to extract key information from the transcript, including important keywords, phrases, andsentences, and present it in a concise and user-friendly format. The tool will utilize natural language processing techniques, such as text summarization, to analyze the videotranscript and identify the most critical information. It will also incorporate machine learning algorithms toimprove its accuracy and efficiency over time. The YouTube transcript summarizer tool will have numerous applications, such as helping researchers andstudents to quickly summarize lectures, interviews, and other educational videos. It will also be useful for
marketers who want to identify relevant keywords and phrases from competitor videos or customer feedback. Additionally, it will be helpful for people with hearing difficulties who prefer to read transcripts rather thanwatching videos. Overall, the YouTube transcript summarizer tool will simplify the process of consuming content fromYouTubevideos, allowing users to save time and improve their learning experience.


# Idea Implementation
(i) Creating a UI using HTML ,CSS and JS (processing and validation of URL of YT video and fetching of transcript using YT API ).
(ii) Preprocessing of transcript using python libraries like NLTK and NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to further process the transcript text.
(iii) Use of summarization algorithms to generate a summary of the transcript.
(iv) Creating a Flask app that takes in the video ID and returns the summary of the transcript and deployment of the APP. Use of summarization algorithms to generate a summary of the transcript.
(v) The youtube video link used in project : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSt9tm3RoUU
